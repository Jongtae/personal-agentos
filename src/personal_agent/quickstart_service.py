#: The one owner-authenticated address that starts a Gmail authorization.

#: in one place without the other would ship a reachable-looking dead link.
GMAIL_CONNECT_PATH = '/google-gmail'
CALENDAR_CONNECT_PATH='/google-calendar'

#: The host AgentOS actually advertises for itself: it is printed at startup,
#: written to `setup-link.txt` and opened in the owner's browser, so it is the
#: host their session cookie is scoped to.  An absolute connect link has to
#: use it.  The OAuth *callback* keeps its own `localhost` host because Google
#: requires a pre-registered redirect URI, and that half needs no cookie -
#: which is exactly why the two may differ without breaking either.

# A successful text completion does not prove that a provider will accept and
# return native tool calls.  Keep the probe deliberately inert: it is never
# executed, so testing a connection cannot change a user's data.  A passed
# probe stays valid until the config changes or the owner re-checks (#619:
# the former 24h expiry flipped a working key to "확인 필요" by time alone).

#: Gmail callback failures that prove the callback carried the exact pending
#: state this owner's `begin_oauth` issued, so the parked Work may be failed.
#:
#: `GmailConnector._pending` compares the supplied state against the stored
#: one with `compare_digest`, and only afterwards can any of these be raised.
#: The three reasons deliberately left out - `missing_or_replayed_state`,
#: `wrong_owner` and `state_mismatch` - are exactly the ones an unauthenticated
#: caller who can reach the loopback callback produces by guessing, and denying
#: on those would let that caller fail the owner's parked request without ever
#: contacting Google.  The list is an allowlist rather than an exclusion so a
#: later reason defaults to leaving the Work parked rather than killing it.

        already owns that whole lifecycle and ``QuickStore`` already enforces
        it; this method is only the surface wiring #394 owns and adds no
        Memory policy of its own.

        ``private_read_sink`` is ``NO_EGRESS_GUARD`` deliberately, which the

        than defaulted.  That guard exists so a *model turn* which reads
        private Memory cannot also reach a public destination in the same
        turn.  This entry point is reached only from an owner-authenticated
        local HTTP request: it constructs no ``Capabilities``, runs no model
        and calls no network tool, so there is no same-turn public
        destination for a guard to protect.  Do not reuse this method from a
        conversation turn - that path must pass the turn-scoped sink instead.

        returns with every candidate row (``workref:`` + the stored work key).
        ``QuickStore._work_binding`` accepts exactly that form, so the owner
        surface can act on a candidate without ever learning or echoing the
