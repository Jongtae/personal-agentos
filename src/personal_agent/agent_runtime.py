# --- Private provenance at the routing site (#449; required by #391) -------
#
# The pre-existing guard ``if self.evidence or self.document_context`` is a
# per-instance flag.  It refuses egress from the Capabilities object that did
# the private read, and it cannot follow private material that is *copied into
# a different context* -- which ``delegate_agent`` does on every call: it
# serialises ``self.evidence[-4:]`` into the child's prompt and then builds the
# child with a fresh empty evidence list and ``document_context`` defaulting to
# False.  A parent holding a connected document was refused ``web_search``; its
# specialist, holding the same document text in its prompt, was not, and all
# three built-in roles declare ``web_search``.
#
# What is tracked below is provenance: a label naming the *source* that put
# material into this Work's context, propagated to every context that material
# is copied into.  It is deliberately not a scan of the outgoing string --
# ``research.validate_public_query`` is that, and its own docstring calls it a
# tripwire, because a paraphrase, translation or model-written summary of a
# private document leaves no surface form to match.  Provenance survives
# paraphrase precisely because it never reads the text.
# History, because two versions of this comment were wrong and the reader
# should be able to see how (#469 corrects the second).
#
# The first version claimed the #391 taint precondition was met.  Independent
# review falsified that in this same function and found two holes --
# delegation laundering material back to a clean parent, and `weather` as an
# unguarded public destination.  Both are closed above.
#
# The second version then said `research.PublicResearch` was "still NOT
# wired" and that the J5 discrimination stayed unreachable from a production
# path.  That stopped being true when PA1-J5-01 / #458 (PR #460) wired it:
# `bounded_public_research` is in `manifests.HOST_ACTIONS`, declared in
# `DEFINITIONS`, and routed in `execute` below.  It also rested on a
# conflation, corrected when #449 closed -- the owner-approved
# `public_page_scope` governs the model-driven `public_page_read` tool, while
# a bounded owner-initiated research workflow is what #386's J5 grants in
# terms ("bounded public search and page reading as needed").  The Epic was
# the authority and it granted the second.
#
# What was accurate then and still is: research reads up to three
# search-discovered URLs and self-approves each one
# (`page_reader.read(url, approved_urls=[url])`), so the owner's approved-page
# scope -- exact normalized URLs, fingerprinted to the model config, see
# AgentService.public_page_boundary -- is never consulted on that path.  The
# mode allowlist and the page cap bound how MUCH is read, not WHICH page.
# That delta is real and is disclosed at the routing branch itself rather
# than only here.
#
# What remains open is recall, not reachability: measured fee 7/10,
# inventory 1/10, payable_total 0/10 (#459).

# CLI route (any earlier assistant answer closed public egress, so a greeting
# did) and from the file-workspace job list on the API route (so an earlier
# `/notes` answer stayed open and its text could be put in a search query).
# Neither is provenance.  Every Work now records, before model use, the
# sources that entered its context -- this turn's spliced/read sources and the
# sources of every earlier Work whose messages it was shown -- and a later Work
# reads those records for exactly the messages it is shown.  Because a reply is
# labelled with everything its worker saw, a summary, repetition or paraphrase
# of private material keeps the label across later turns and restarts.
#
# A Work with no record (every Work before #605, or one whose record could not
# be written) is `unrecorded`: it closes public destinations.  Migration never
# guesses that old material was public.
#
# Owner-typed conversation is recorded as `owner-conversation` and is NOT
# relabelled public.  Its window, `owner`, is deliberately outside
# EGRESS_TAINT_WINDOWS: within a Work the owner directs, the owner's own
# earlier chat is not a private *store*, and closing it would close every
# second-turn lookup (the #603 greeting finding).  Tightening that is a change

 Older turns are dropped before the current request is ever shortened.

 ``current_context`` is the optional bounded current-context section

 ``profile`` is the bounded owner profile snapshot text
 (``MemoryService.profile_snapshot(...)['text']``, #658).  It is counted
 against the same byte budget before older turns are packed, so a long
 profile shortens the conversation window rather than the request; None or
 empty sends nothing and changes nothing.

 candidate, a calendar draft awaiting approval - and that was invisible.
 The call was counted successful, the turn reported ``succeeded``, and the

 empty search, an empty calendar window and a partial research brief are
 *not* withheld effects: nothing was declined and the result already says
 what it found.

 ``advanced`` separates the two shapes this covers.  A held memory write
 delivered nothing the owner asked for, so a turn whose only call was that
 one is ``failed`` - claiming '일부 단계만 완료했습니다' when no step
 completed is the same unobserved claim one level down.  A calendar draft
