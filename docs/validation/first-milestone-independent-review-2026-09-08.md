# First milestone independent review — 2026-09-08

Issue: #282. Reviewer: independent `closeout_review` agent. Requested model/reasoning: inherited parent defaults, no override. Tool-accepted model/reasoning: not exposed, so no model claim. Exclusive file ownership: none; read-only repository and GitHub inspection, no Docker execution or external mutation.

## Findings and dispositions

1. **P1, PR #281 remains unfinished.** `scripts/agentos_doctor.py` at head `8cc9b8f9ad1345e81346763564cd04bde31637c3`, lines 22–24 and 55–66, invokes Docker with inherited HOME/DOCKER_CONFIG/DOCKER_HOST/context and implicit Compose environment-file loading. The no owner-home/credentials/external-contact assertion is not enforced. Preserve branch; do not merge or include in the completed baseline.
2. **P2, PR #281 candidate procedure is incomplete.** Default candidate `53912eeb1357ced37031234b1e5376f024dd0a96` predates the doctor script. Checking out that candidate removes the script; executing on the PR checkout fails candidate matching. A validated separate-tool checkout procedure or a new validated candidate is needed.
3. **P2, PR #281 port check can diverge from Compose.** The default port 8787 ignores AGENTOS_PORT. Fixture tests stub preflight and do not prove environment isolation or documented execution. Required CI run 34212792766 succeeded, but acceptance is not complete. Tracker/roadmap/ledger closeout is also absent.
4. **TOP development evidence is complete; administration was stale.** #272/#273, #275/#277, #278 are merged; candidate `53912eeb1357ced37031234b1e5376f024dd0a96` has matching successful main validate run 34204797899. Closeout #278 validate run 34205632000 succeeded. #265 remained open, plan next_goal remained active, and several next-action cells described already completed work. #282 reconciles these without claiming operating deployment.

## Boundary

The OP-03 findings belong to the unmerged optional diagnostic work, not the immutable completed TOP candidate. OWNER-01 login, credentials, provider allowlist, optional Telegram/OAuth, health and a live task remain separate operating work. LEGACY-01 is resolved by the recorded owner decision #279 to retain the prototype as historical. Final cleanup review and merged CI linkage are recorded under #282.
