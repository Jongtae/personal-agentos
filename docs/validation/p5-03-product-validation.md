# P5-03 product validation

Validated on 2026-09-07 against `v1.0.0` source commit
`15e691ad5fc866e3587ca1850f0c717b0c101877`.

## Passed v1 evidence

- 77 automated tests passed.
- The Homebrew-installed CLI completed setup, authenticated note persistence,
  restart persistence, and single-instance acceptance.
- Docker Compose built a disposable image, passed `/healthz`, and retained an
  AgentOS note after container recreation with a named volume.
- The existing `gpt-4o-mini` connection completed native tool validation,
  web search, document search/read, bounded delegation, ordinary conversation,
  and note saving.
- The same live model read TXT, Markdown, PDF, DOCX, and XLSX documents with
  source-location evidence. It also passed external-model document approval
  and approval-reset acceptance.
- Documentation now reflects v1 document, Compose, backup, and manifest
  capabilities. Reviewed declaration-only plugin manifests are reachable by
  `agentos plugins` without executing third-party code.

## Telegram continuity acceptance

After restarting AgentOS, the paired private Telegram account sent a new
request. The shared store recorded the request and response on the Telegram
channel; its job completed successfully with delivery state `sent` through the
verified `gpt-4o-mini` connection. The same store contains the shared web and
Telegram history. Bot tokens and message contents are not included here.

## Post-v1 product vision gaps

- Native desktop and mobile companion applications.
- KakaoTalk and WeChat channel feasibility and integrations.
- Managed, multi-tenant hosting with tenant isolation and billing.
