# Delivery tracks

Active work is executed only from a goal-ready issue and active delivery-plan entry under the [Goal Execution Contract](docs/goal-execution-contract.en.md). Status tables are trackers, not authority to activate reserved work.

## Active delivery

| Work unit | Issue | Branch | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SCN-D-01: first live-use scenario contract | [#301](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/301) | `codex/scn-01-live-use-scenarios` | active design: define the approved research-to-action and reviewed-sharing journeys; no provider configuration or KakaoTalk delivery claim. |

## Completed repository maintenance

| Work unit | Issue | Branch | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CI-01: GitHub Actions validation audit | [#303](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/303) | `codex/actions-ci-audit` | complete (PR #304 merged; required `validate` passed) |

## Closed top-level program

| Goal | Issue | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TOP | [#265](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/265) | Development complete on immutable candidate `53912eeb1357ced37031234b1e5376f024dd0a96` and main `validate` run `34204797899`; development closeout #282; no active successor. OWNER-01 remains separate operating work; LEGACY-01 resolved by #279 (historical only). |

## First milestone consolidation

[#282](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/282) merged the report in [PR #283](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/pull/283) (`0025148e7ab30bd27c4b1ca761b3ba9702b0e0f8`, required validate `34213401518` success). See the [2026-09-08 first milestone report](docs/first-milestone-report.ko.md), full issue/PR/branch inventory, independent review, and evidence-based administrative cleanup. OP-03 [#280](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/280) / PR #281 remains unfinished; passing CI is not acceptance completion. Four dirty worktrees and that unmerged branch are preserved.

## Maintained baseline

| Track | Goal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1 / M0–M6 | Self-hosted personal runtime, documents, continuity, manifests, and v1 acceptance | Complete baseline through 1.0.3 |
| v1 / M7 | Telegram task-card polish and release gate | Frozen maintenance; it does not block Hub v2 |

## Historical: MP1 remediation

The original MP1 D/I iterations remain merged historical work. [#214](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/214) recorded the remediation: R-01 ReAct orchestration, R-02 A2A completion, R-03 Calendar completion, R-04 Drive completion, and R-05 end-to-end release acceptance have now merged in order. MP1 is development complete on mock-contract evidence; operating-mode configuration remains separate.

| [MP1-R-01 / #216](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/216) | Deliver policy-owned ReAct orchestration, lifecycle invocation gate, redacted evidence, deterministic recovery, and shared HTTP/Telegram entry point | Complete; merged in #217 with automated mock validation |
| [MP1-R-02 / #218](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/218) | Complete A2A Card, progress, timeout, cancellation, artifact, minimum-context, and portable-evidence contracts through the orchestrator | Complete; merged in #219 with automated mock validation |
| [MP1-R-03 / #220](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/220) | Complete Calendar owner-bound draft, approval, create, failure-state, and portable-evidence contracts through the orchestrator | Complete; merged in #221 with automated mock validation |
| [MP1-R-04 / #222](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/222) | Complete Drive selected-excerpt approval, re-auth, lifecycle recovery, and portable-evidence contracts through the orchestrator | Complete; merged in #223 with automated mock validation |
| [MP1-R-05 / #224](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/224) | Verify the full new owner-local Personal Space, Drive, A2A, Calendar, lifecycle, fallback, and export/restore journey through the service/orchestrator | Complete; merged in #225 with automated mock validation |

## Historical: Personal AgentOS v1 release delivery

| Iteration | Goal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [V1-02 / #137](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/137) | Telegram daily-work task cards, approvals, cancellation, and truthful recovery | Historical implementation record; it is not an active delivery selector |
| [V1-03 / #138](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/138) | Opt-in local documents and context in Telegram work with source evidence and external-sharing approval | Historical implementation record; it is not an active delivery selector |
| [V1-04 / #139](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/139) | Docker Compose VPS health, update, backup/restore, and Telegram continuity boundaries | Historical implementation record; it is not an active delivery selector |

## Historical: AgentOS Hub v2

| Milestone | Goal | Issue | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Record Hub v2 product basis and delivery sequence | [#103](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/103) | Historical tracker; top-level inventory is authoritative |
| M1 | Connect subscription engines without API-key setup | [#104](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/104) | Complete on fixture evidence |
| M1.5 | Isolate each personal AgentOS runtime from the Mac host | [#109](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/109) | Complete on fixture evidence; operating verification remains TOP-01 |
| M2 | Run subscription engines through AgentOS-owned tools | [#105](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/105) | Complete on fixture evidence |
| M3 | Deliver first work through an owner-created BotFather personal bot | [#106](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/106) | Complete on fixture evidence; live token pairing is owner operating work |
| M4 | Build an opt-in local context inbox | [#107](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/107) | Complete on fixture evidence |
| M5 | Provide trusted assistants and portable personal state | [#108](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/108) | Complete on fixture evidence |

The Hub v2 Epic is [#102](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/102). Its still-open GitHub state is an administrative reconciliation item, not an active delivery selector. The top-level inventory and active delivery plan select work; historical v1 records remain in the ledger.

## Historical: AgentOS UX v1.1

The [UX v1.1 epic](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/149) records the delivered minimalist personal-agent DM: [UX-01](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/150) through [UX-05](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/154) cover DM home, opt-in workspaces, Telegram continuity, safety/recovery language, context selection, and release acceptance. Its still-open GitHub epic is an administrative reconciliation item, not work to restart. See [the UX product basis](docs/ux-v1.1-personal-agent-dm.ko.md).

## Historical: Telegram Conversation UX v1.2

[UX-06 / #162](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/162) is delivered historical work. It makes the paired Telegram chat a deliberate assistant conversation: a concise acknowledgement, progress only when needed, one readable terminal answer, optional detail, and private owner-bound actions with truthful recovery.

### UX-06 — Telegram conversation bubbles

[#162](https://github.com/Jongtae/personal-agentos/issues/162) is complete. Each Telegram request now uses one status-card sequence and one terminal answer bubble; long answers use a larger readable preview and direct the owner to local web history. Automated root-suite coverage passed, and the deployed Telegram desktop flow was observed to edit the card to completion and show one terminal answer without a generic completion duplicate.
